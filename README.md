# BikeSharing

## Overview of the statistical analysis ##

The purpose of this statistical work is to use public data from the Citi Bike bikeshare program in NYC and Tableau to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, IA is a solid business proposal. This project used Tableau to visualize duration and times of the day and week that bikes are utilized and also the breakdown of the bike’s users by gender, which could help with better marketing for the business idea.

**The entire tableau project** can be found here on Tableau Public: [link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/asa.holley#!/)

**description:** The two visualizations above show  that most bike rides are under 20 minutes in total duration and  that peak hours generally revolve around the morning and evening commute hours. This could mean that the bikes are utilized commuting, which could be a great marketing angle for a place like Des Moines. It also means that late evening and very early mornings are the best times to do Bike maintenance.

**description:** The heatmap illustrates that the bikes are most utilized during peak commuting hours during the work week, but are more consistently used throughout the day on weekends and are rather heavily used through the weekend. This means the bikes should be used every day of the week.

**description:** The two visualizations above clearly show that the bike sharing program is more utilized by men than woman, in overall share of rides across all durations of trips. This means that when marketing the bike sharing program there should be a focus on marketing towards men given their proclivity towards using the bikes.

**description:** This heatmap shows that when it comes to general customers and subscribers of the bike sharing program gender plays a more nuanced role. While subscribers remain largely men, general customers are more evenly split between men and women. This means there could be an opening to convert more women to be subscribers in the Des Moines.


## Summary ##
Overall, it appears for a Des Moines ride share to be successful it should be geared towards commuters and men at least during the week. For weekend tourists or "for fun riders" there shouldn’t be a gender biases in the marketing. There is always ample opportunity to increase engagement for women for a new bike sharing program the casual riders in the NYC example are more evenly split between gender.

Other visualization that would be good to include:
  * The cost to repair and replace bikes as well as the amount of time it takes to repair a bike and perform maintenance on average. The could be presented in a number of ways including a bar chart or a heatmap
  * A good chart would be the difference in ride duration between the weekends and week days in the form of a line chart.
